## 🧠 Motivation

This project was inspired by a simple personal problem:

> I wasn't fully aware of how much money I spent every day.

Small expenses like coffee, food, subscriptions, and impulse purchases often accumulated without visibility.  
So, I built this tool to help track spending and make more intentional financial decisions.
